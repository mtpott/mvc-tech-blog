## Description

This is a CMS-style blog site designed for developers to post and discuss all things technology. We were tasked with creating this blog site using the Model View Controller (MVC) paradigm. By separating these concerns into their own categories, the organization and makeup of the site is simple and easy to follow. The Model for this site is handled by Sequelize, View by the Handlebars templates, and Controllers by Express.js. Within this paradigm, the controller makes requests and communicates with the model, which in turn responds with the view.
